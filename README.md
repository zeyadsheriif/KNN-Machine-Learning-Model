# KNN-Machine-Learning-Model

Project steps:

1-Download “IRIS” Data set (three flowers) [150 Samples]

2-Use PCA to visualize the Dataset (as 2-D) [Optional]

3-Divide the data into 80% Training, 20% test [120 , 30 samples]

4-Apply KNN with K=3, 5, and 7 on Test Samples.

5-Calculate the classification accuracy for each K, Which is the best?

6-Normalize the IRIS dataset and repeat steps 4 and 5.
